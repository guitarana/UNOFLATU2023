Ahda Yunia Sekar F.~Telkom University~53 x 53 cm~ Batik and Acrylic Paint on Cotton~Painting~The Living Things No. 1~https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yYFSzw7QaUs7auZWqz5acT4Yyz3KHahj/view?usp=share_link~In this work, I explore batik techniques with painting to capture the visual objects that I observe, namely the interactions of living things with the objects around them. The batik technique is a textile craft that creates decorative elements on the textile surface. By combining batik techniques with painting techniques, I want to get out of the existing identity and standard of batik to create a new visual and deeper meaning of batik personally. Through this batik work, I also want to explore how far I can explore this technique to become a medium for capturing visual objects.~true

The selected batik is Buketan Batik from Pekalongan.

Parametric design unlocks the potential to create intricate and complex designs that traditional methods struggle to achieve while also providing enhanced precision, control, and flexibility in the design process. For example, using algorithms of Voronoi cells and organic forms is a model for managing the expansion of everything in nature to mix with the work and dealing with structural joints, which results in not only lines and unique forms. It also can help transfer forces along the structure, and the following advantage is the speed of the design process. Parametric design is a powerful approach to design that allows for greater flexibility, precision, and control in the design process. By defining rules and parameters, designers can create complex, intricate designs optimized for specific conditions or requirements.~false

The house with an area of 82 m2, has a cluster concept, Healthy and Energy Saving House, is a ""Light House"" type that supports energy saving and a healthy lifestyle. The architectural concept is combined with a Mid-century interior concept.

In the cluster of Kaza type houses, Grand Sharon Residence, the application of a Mid-century design style is felt to be able to build a bright interior atmosphere. The form of a minimalist house requires a touch of vintage design style so that there is a contrast between the shape of the building and the processing of the space. The processing of space elements is modern minimalist following the existing shape of the building, and the furniture uses retro-vintage forms.~false

	I would like to express my feeling towards the global changes, natural surrounding, sickness etc. We have to be fully alert & aware of our surrounding. I compare it to the passage of time which we move through ,similarly to objects floating on the waves i.e. raft, leaves  which float on the river. We note that while they move along the wave, they have to meet various obstruction against the wave to go over and not being drown in the river.
	I express my understanding through abstract form i.e. square, leaves placed on the surface of thread woven as the surface of canvas. It can be viewed from above and see objects as they float along the river. Bright color thread draws our eyes to see the movement. These are used to express movement, obstruction, mindfully we need to control so that we can overcome the obstruction on the path.

Thanawat Phetploy~Silpakorn University~35 x 50 cm (3 pieces)~Material Board (Dired papaya)~Material Board~Dried Papaya~https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Gk5xwZFj9VNGul1-UHH5KneLTv49ahJ4/view?usp=share_link~Papaya is a local fruit, easy to be found and spread across Thailand. It also has been consumed by Thai people and shared a great deal of economic prospects. It could be easily assumed that papaya can be found everywhere in Thailand. Consequently, the waste from papaya consumption is growing as well. Therefore, this collection aims to use dried papaya peel and interpret it into material that could apply to garments and textiles. Even though this collection is only a mere experiment, I hope that it would be an inspiration to others to expand this knowledge further.       ~false

The networked tensile forces generate internal compression within the transmissive structure, and the compression or tensile strength parts are not connected or touch each other. Tensegrity structures are often present in wide-ranging work, and it has the potential to be lightweight, flexible, and adjustable but still strong and deployable. The summary presents background on the structure of Tensegrity, definitions, classification types, and properties of the Tensegrity structure to be a database and knowledge that can bring data to create a new type of Tensegrity structure in the future, develop the structure into a variety of designs and maximize design efficiency.~false

It imparts a slightly sweet flavor and aroma to the dish when it is cooked, usually by steaming. Banana leaves are biodegradable, making them eco-friendly and sustainable. Food is also related to our daily life.  So I chose these objects to metaphorically communicate my thoughts.
Some time ago we had to fight the corona virus, wrap it up, put it out in the sun. There is a time to contemplate too, having a relationship with the Almighty. After what we've been through, hopefully there will be brighter days ahead.
