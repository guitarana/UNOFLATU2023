Ahda Yunia Sekar F.~Telkom University~53 x 53 cm~ Batik and Acrylic Paint on Cotton~Painting~The Living Things No. 1~https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yYFSzw7QaUs7auZWqz5acT4Yyz3KHahj/view?usp=share_link~In this work, I explore batik techniques with painting to capture the visual objects that I observe, namely the interactions of living things with the objects around them. The batik technique is a textile craft that creates decorative elements on the textile surface. By combining batik techniques with painting techniques, I want to get out of the existing identity and standard of batik to create a new visual and deeper meaning of batik personally. Through this batik work, I also want to explore how far I can explore this technique to become a medium for capturing visual objects.~true~#

This silhouette photo uses a Canon 18-200mm lens with a 5.6 aperture. The shutter speed is 250 and uses ISO 100, so it can record objects and colours naturally. The position of the light is behind the object of 2 people who are boarding a boat, so that the background gets full light and the main object appears black.~true~#

During the pandemic, the negative impacts were felt, especially for the lower class, such as the problem of losing their livelihood, finding a job that was difficult yet the necessities of life were too expensive. The pandemic has also changed the order of life on all fronts. We should be grateful, able to face it with steadfastness. We can still run the wheel of life upright. We are able to adapt to new ways so that we can overcome this epidemic and we can solve problems one by one.

The selected batik is Buketan Batik from Pekalongan. Batik Buketan is one of the most famous batiks in Indonesia, firstly because of the beauty of its motifs which were brought from European Art Nouveau styles by the Dutch who came to Indonesia. Then the color combination of Buketan Batik is also very colorful and charming, just like coastal batik, which is always dynamic.

Meanwhile, with the concept of increasing the aesthetic value & uniqueness of Batik Buketan, this work combines it with Tulle Fabric. Tulle which has a transparent-smooth-expanding character, is explored and combined with Batik Buketan in one composition to optimize the unique character & aesthetic value of these two fabrics with different characteristics.~true~#

Triman Pharmaceutical Industries is a company engaged in the pharmaceutical sector since 1968 in the city of Bandung.

Basically literally then it will talk about the process of going in and out of the inner air creature life. But, breath can also be interpreted more specifically in a lifeless medium, money. Money is like a breath that exhales various charges in an era. For example, the Rp. 10 denomination in 1950 when the Round Table Conference finally spawned an agreement to form the United Republic of Indonesia. It takes a face as well as a one-way message on a bill, and that’s how it went up to today’s newest issue. In line with that, breath in society is like a staple on which life depends. Its existence is really crucial, just look at the many incidents, a staple food called rice remains a priority. It is as if they are separate, in fact, money and rice are connected as well as breath. All that is needed while individuals are still alive (1) and stop when the individual dies (0)”~true~#
