Ahda Yunia Sekar F.~Telkom University~53 x 53 cm~ Batik and Acrylic Paint on Cotton~Painting~The Living Things No. 1~https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yYFSzw7QaUs7auZWqz5acT4Yyz3KHahj/view?usp=share_link~In this work, I explore batik techniques with painting to capture the visual objects that I observe, namely the interactions of living things with the objects around them. The batik technique is a textile craft that creates decorative elements on the textile surface. By combining batik techniques with painting techniques, I want to get out of the existing identity and standard of batik to create a new visual and deeper meaning of batik personally. Through this batik work, I also want to explore how far I can explore this technique to become a medium for capturing visual objects.~true~#
Anak Agung Gde Bagus Udayana~Institut Seni Indonesia Denpasar~50 x 65 cm~Print On Canvas~Photography~Romantisme~https://drive.google.com/file/d/19_OirJCejJ35Rfe7eq7c_it3PV7dyTIv/view?usp=share_link~Romanticism in photography depicts two teenage figures who are engrossed in being alone with a boat in the middle of the sea when the sun is about to shine in the morning. The photo was taken using the Silhouette photography technique, silhouette photography is a photography technique by taking the main focus object that appears black because the average light is measured on the main object background.
This silhouette photo uses a Canon 18-200mm lens with a 5.6 aperture. The shutter speed is 250 and uses ISO 100, so it can record objects and colours naturally. The position of the light is behind the object of 2 people who are boarding a boat, so that the background gets full light and the main object appears black.~true~#

Through offerings, humans hope to always get goodness in their lives. Even in the midst of the plague that hit, it is necessary to submit to the universe. The offerings are proof of the existence of a human relationship to God and the universe, where harmony and harmony with nature again needs to be rehabilitated.~true~#
